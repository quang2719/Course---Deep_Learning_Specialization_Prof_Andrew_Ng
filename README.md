# 🌟 Deep Learning Specialization: Notes, Assignments, & Quizzes 🌟
Welcome to my **Deep Learning Specialization** repository! This repo documents my learning process while completing the Deep Learning Specialization by [Prof. Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) on Coursera. 🚀

> “872,517 learners, 134,127 reviews, and a rating of 4.9 stars — it's one of the most highly regarded specializations out there.”


## 📚 Course Overview

The specialization consists of 5 intense courses, focusing on deep learning topics like neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, NLP, and more. Each course comes with quizzes, hands-on programming assignments, and real-world applications.

- **Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
- **Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization**
- **Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects**
- **Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks**
- **Course 5: Sequence Models** (Coming Soon)

## 💻 What's Included in This Repository?

- **Course Notes**: Detailed notes for each course, with tips that helped me get through tough concepts and quizzes. 📒
- **Programming Assignments**: All the code I wrote for the programming assignments, explained and ready to help you solve tricky problems. 💻
